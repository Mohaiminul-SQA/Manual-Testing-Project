# Manual Testing Project(DRIVER)

This repository contains documentation related to the testing process for DRIVER (Data for Road Incident Visualization Evaluation and Reporting), a specialized software tool designed for the purpose of collecting and analyzing road accident data. The testing process is divided into the following stages:

1. [Test Cases Estimation](#test-estimation)
2. [Test Plan](#test-estimation)
3. [Test Cases Design](#test-case)
4. [Test Cases Execution](#test-case-execution)
5. [Bug Report in Redmine](#bug-report-in-redmine)
6. [QA Report](#qa-report)

## Test Estimation

In this stage, I estimated the effort required for testing based on the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documentation.

## Test Planning

Once the test estimation is complete, I proceed to create Test Plan. In that plan I provide an overview of the project then mention the scope of the testing, working schedule,Testing Techniques, Strategy etc.

## Test Cases Design

After the Test Planning I started to write test cases based on the SRS Document. I always try to understand the requirement and to create comprehensive test cases to achive the maximum test coverage.

## Bug Report

If any issues or defects are identified during test case execution, they are documented in a bug report. Bug Report were written both in .doc file and in Redmine. Each Bug Id is coming from Redmine Bug Id.

## QA Report

Finally, the QA team compiles a report summarizing the testing process and its outcomes. The documentation for this stage includes:
