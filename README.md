# Manual Testing Project(DRIVER)

This repository contains documentation related to the testing process for DRIVER (Data for Road Incident Visualization Evaluation and Reporting), a specialized software tool designed for the purpose of collecting and analyzing road accident data. The testing process is divided into the following stages:

1. [Test Cases Estimation](#test-estimation)
2. [Test Plan](#test-estimation)
3. [Test Cases Design](#test-case-documentation)
4. [Test Cases Execution](#test-case-execution)
5. [Bug Report in Redmine](#bug-report)
6. [QA Report](#qa-report)

## Test Estimation

In this stage, we estimate the effort required for testing based on the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documentation. The key documents for this stage include:

- [SRS Document](./docs/srs-document.pdf)
- [Test Estimation Report](./docs/test-estimation-report.pdf)

## Test Case Documentation

Once the test estimation is complete, we proceed to create detailed test cases. The relevant documents for this stage include:

- [Test Case Document](./docs/test-case-document.pdf)

## Test Case Execution

This stage involves the actual execution of test cases and recording the results. The documentation for this stage includes:

- [Test Case Execution Report](./docs/test-case-execution-report.pdf)

## Bug Report

If any issues or defects are identified during test case execution, they are documented in a bug report. The key document for this stage is:

- [Bug Report](./docs/bug-report.pdf)

## QA Report

Finally, the QA team compiles a report summarizing the testing process and its outcomes. The documentation for this stage includes:

- [QA Report](./docs/qa-report.pdf)
