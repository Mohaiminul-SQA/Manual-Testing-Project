# Manual Testing Project(DRIVER)

This repository contains documentation related to the testing process for DRIVER (Data for Road Incident Visualization Evaluation and Reporting), a specialized software tool designed for the purpose of collecting and analyzing road accident data. The testing process is divided into the following stages:

1. [Test Estimation](#test-estimation)
2. [Test Plan](#test-plan)
3. [Test Cases Design](#test-cases-design)
4. [Test Cases Execution](#test-cases-execution)
5. [Bug Report in Redmine](#bug-report-in-redmine)
6. [QA Report](#qa-report)

## Test Estimation

In this stage, I estimated the effort required for testing based on the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documentation.

## Test Planning

Once the test estimation is complete, I proceed to create a Test Plan. In that plan, I provide an overview of the project and then mention the scope of the testing, working schedule, Testing Techniques, Strategy, etc.

## Test Cases Design

After the Test Planning, I started to write test cases based on the SRS Document. I always try to understand the requirement and to create comprehensive test cases to achive the maximum test coverage.

## Test Cases Execution

This stage involves the actual execution of test cases and the recording of the results.

## Bug Report in Redmine

If any issues or defects are identified during test case execution, they are documented in a bug report. Bug Reports were written both in the .doc file and in Redmine. Each Bug ID is coming from Redmine Bug ID.

## QA Report

Finally, the QA team compiles a report summarizing the testing process and its outcomes. A Detailed Screenshot is given below.
